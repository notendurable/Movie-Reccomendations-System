# Movie-Recomendations-System
Created basice Movie Recommendation System a Data Science Python3 project created with the help of Panda Library.
The Dataset that was used is a subset of MovieLens Dataset.

#Description
Created a interactive recommendations widget in Jupyter that has a text input bar to input your movie whose recommendation you seek. Output will give you top 9 movies that match and are recommended movies for you to watch next. With the ontype function it becomes easier for users as it gives faster results and is more efficient.
